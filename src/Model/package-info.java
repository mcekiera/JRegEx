 * Provide classes to create logical representation of regular expression, as whole and its elements, and representing

 * General Expression class contains data about structure of processed regular expression, and its matching properties.
 * Regular expression constructs are represented by groups of compositional structured classes, expanding one abstract
 * Construct class. Representation of matched contents is divided into overall and detailed (for every
